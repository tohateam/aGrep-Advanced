# aGrep-Advanced

<b>Search and replace in text files</b><br><br>
The program is distributed <b>"as is"</b>.<br>
The author is not responsible for lost or corrupted files.<br>
The program was created for personal use, and since I am not a programmer, <br>
the program code is written on the principle that <b>"I know and I can do it"</b>.<br>
I will be glad to any help in improving the program.<br>

When creating the program, freely distributed projects and libraries were used:<br>
aGrep: https://github.com/jiro-aqua/aGrep<br>
ExFilePicker: https://github.com/bartwell/ExFilePicker<br><br>
Thank you.
